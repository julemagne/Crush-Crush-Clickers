###### Scripting with AutoHotkey Version 1.1.24.02 to automate game's tasks

You can download AutoHotkey from www.autohotkey.com

The coordinates I use work for my personal computer's resolution and likely will not work for yours.  Use AutoHotkey > WindowSpy function to get the coordinates of Mouse Position using Relative (default).  The Sleep timeouts work for my personal Reset Boost speed but you will likely need to adjust.  Sleeps are in milliseconds. 

After opening the file, press F1 to start it.  Press F5 if you wish to abort the script.  Press F6 to exit AutoHotkey.
