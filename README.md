### Firstly, congratulations on getting to the point where you need to buy tens of thousands of presents at a time!  You already have a click forever macro and know how to adjust your computer's date & time settings.  Here's how I can help you now:

The number after `Loop` is how many of the items you will purchase.  You can adjust it for different characters' requirements.

The coordinates I use work for my personal computer's resolution and likely will not work for yours.  Use AutoHotkey > WindowSpy function to get the coordinates of Mouse Position using Relative (default).  

The `Sleep` timeouts work for my personal Reset Boost speed but you will likely need to adjust.  `Sleep`s are in milliseconds. 

After opening the file, press `F1` to start the macro.  Press `F5` to reload the script to have newly saved changes take effect when you next run the script, or to just abort the script.  Press `F6` to exit AutoHotkey.
